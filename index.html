<details style="max-width:600px"><summary>Abstract</summary>We uncover a close link between outside options and risk attitude: when a decision-maker gains access to an outside option, her behaviour becomes less risk-averse, and conversely, any observed decrease of risk-aversion can be explained by an outside option having been made available. <a href="https://www.ludvigsinander.net/pdf/oo_slides_anim.pdf?v=5" style="text-decoration:none; color:inherit;">We</a> characterise the comparative statics of risk-aversion, delineating how effective risk attitude (i.e. actual choice among risky prospects) varies with the outside option and with the decision-maker&rsquo;s &lsquo;true&rsquo; risk attitude. We prove that outside options are special: among transformations of a decision problem, those that amount to adding an outside option are the only ones that always reduce risk-aversion.</details>

with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gregoriocurello">Gregorio Curello</a><br />
<details style="max-width:600px"><summary>Abstract</summary>In the persuasion model, apart from a few special cases, comparative statics has been an open question. <a href="https://www.ludvigsinander.net/pdf/CSP_slides_anim.pdf?v=5" style="text-decoration:none; color:inherit;">We</a> answer it, delineating which shifts of the sender&rsquo;s interim payoff lead her optimally to choose a more informative signal. Our first theorem identifies a coarse notion of &lsquo;increased convexity&rsquo; that we show characterises those shifts of the sender&rsquo;s interim payoff that lead her optimally to choose <i>no less</i> informative signals. To strengthen this conclusion to &lsquo;<i>more</i> informative&rsquo; requires further assumptions: our second theorem identifies the necessary and sufficient condition on the sender&rsquo;s interim payoff, which strictly generalises the convex&ndash;concave (&lsquo;S&rsquo;) shape commonly imposed in the literature. We identify conditions under which increased alignment of interests between sender and receiver leads to comparative statics, and study a number of applications.</details>

<details style="max-width:600px"><summary>Abstract</summary>We study the interplay of information and prior (mis)perceptions in a Phelps&ndash;Aigner&ndash;Cain-type model of statistical discrimination in the labor market. We decompose the effect on average pay of an increase in how informative observables are about workers&rsquo; skill into a non-negative <i>instrumental</i> component, reflecting increased surplus due to better matching of workers with tasks, and a <i>perception-correcting</i> component capturing how extra information diminishes the importance of prior misperceptions about the distribution of skills in the worker population. We sign the perception-correcting term: it is non-negative (non-positive) if the population was ex-ante under-perceived (over-perceived). We then consider the implications for pay gaps between equally-skilled populations that differ in information, perceptions, or both, and identify conditions under which improving information narrows pay gaps.</details>

<details style="max-width:600px"><summary>Abstract</summary>In finite problems comprising objects, situations, and an object- and situation-contingent payoff function, we study the comparative statics of the set of undominated objects, meaning those for which there exists no mixture over objects that is superior whatever the situation. We consider both weak and strict dominance (corresponding to different degrees of &lsquo;strictness&rsquo; in the definition of superiority). Our main theorem characterises those payoff transformations which robustly expand the not-weakly-dominated and not-strictly-dominated sets: the necessary and sufficient condition is that payoffs be transformed separately across situations, in either a monotone&ndash;concave or a constant manner. We apply our results to Pareto frontiers and games.</details>

<i><b>Games and Economic Behavior</b>,</i> 2026<br />
<details style="max-width:600px"><summary>Abstract</summary>Most comparisons of preferences are instances of <i>single-crossing dominance.</i> We examine the lattice structure of single-crossing dominance, proving characterisation, existence and uniqueness results for minimum upper bounds of arbitrary sets of preferences. We apply these theorems to derive new comparative statics theorems for collective choice and under analyst uncertainty, and to characterise a general &lsquo;maxmin&rsquo; class of uncertainty-averse preferences over Savage acts.</details>

<details style="max-width:600px"><summary>Abstract</summary>How best to incentivise <i>prompt</i> disclosure? We study this question in a general model in which a technological breakthrough occurs at an uncertain time and is privately observed by an agent, and a principal must incentivise disclosure via her control of a payoff-relevant physical allocation. We uncover a deadline structure of optimal mechanisms: they have a simple deadline form in an important special case, and a graduated deadline structure in general. We apply our results to the design of unemployment insurance schemes.</details>

<details style="max-width:600px"><summary>Abstract</summary>I revisit the standard moral-hazard model, in which an agent&rsquo;s preference over contracts is rooted in costly effort choice. <a href="https://www.ludvigsinander.net/pdf/optim_slides_anim.pdf?v=5" style="text-decoration:none; color:inherit;">I</a> characterise the behavioural content of the model in terms of empirically testable axioms, and show that the model&rsquo;s parameters are identified. I propose general behavioural definitions of relative (over)confidence and optimism, and characterise these in terms of the parameters of the moral-hazard model. My formal results are rooted in a simple but powerful insight: that the moral-hazard model is closely related to the well-known &lsquo;variational&rsquo; model of choice under uncertainty.</details>

<i><b>Econometrica</b>,</i> 2025<br />
<details style="max-width:600px"><summary>Abstract</summary>We develop a theory of monotone comparative statics for models with adjustment costs. <a href="https://www.ludvigsinander.net/pdf/adj_slides_anim.pdf?v=5" style="text-decoration:none; color:inherit;">We</a> show that comparative-statics conclusions may be drawn under the usual ordinal complementarity assumptions on the objective function, assuming very little about costs: only a mild monotonicity condition is required. We use this insight to prove a general Le Chatelier principle: under the ordinal complementarity assumptions, if short-run adjustment is subject to a monotone cost, then the long-run response to a shock is greater than the short-run response. We extend these results to a fully dynamic model of adjustment over time: the Le Chatelier principle remains valid, and under slightly stronger assumptions, optimal adjustment follows a monotone path. We apply our results to models of saving, production, pricing, labor supply and investment.</details>

<i><b>Review of Economic Studies</b>,</i> 2023<br />
<details style="max-width:600px"><summary>Abstract</summary>We study the susceptibility of committee governance (e.g. by boards of directors), modelled as the collective determination of a ranking of a set of alternatives, to manipulation of the order in which pairs of alternatives are voted on&mdash;<i>agenda-manipulation</i>. We exhibit an agenda strategy called <i>insertion sort</i> that allows a self-interested committee chair with no knowledge of how votes will be cast to do as well as if she had complete knowledge. Strategies with this &lsquo;regret-freeness&rsquo; property are characterised by their <i>efficiency</i>, and by their avoidance of two intuitive errors. What distinguishes regret-free strategies from each other is how they prioritise among alternatives; insertion sort prioritises <i>lexicographically</i>.</details>

<i><b>Theoretical Economics</b>,</i> 2023<br />
<details style="max-width:600px"><summary>Abstract</summary>What are the value and form of optimal persuasion when information can be generated only slowly? We study this question in a dynamic model in which a &lsquo;sender&rsquo; provides public information over time subject to a graduality constraint, and a decision-maker takes an action in each period. Using a novel &lsquo;viscosity&rsquo; dynamic programming principle, we characterise the sender&rsquo;s equilibrium value function and information provision. We show that the graduality constraint inhibits information provision relative to unconstrained persuasion. The gap can be substantial, but closes as the constraint slackens. Contrary to unconstrained persuasion, less-than-full information may be provided even if players have aligned preferences but different prior beliefs.</details>

<i><b>Mathematical Social Sciences</b>,</i> 2020<br />
<details style="max-width:600px"><summary>Abstract</summary>A strictly strategy-proof mechanism is one that asks agents to use <i>strictly</i> dominant strategies. In the canonical one-dimensional mechanism design setting with private values, we show that strict strategy-proofness is equivalent to <i>strict</i> monotonicity plus the envelope formula, echoing a well-known characterisation of (weak) strategy-proofness. A consequence is that strategy-proofness can be made strict by an arbitrarily small modification, so that strictness is &lsquo;essentially for free&rsquo;.</details>

<details style="max-width:600px"><summary>Abstract</summary>We study the link between Phelps&ndash;Aigner&ndash;Cain-type statistical discrimination and familiar notions of statistical informativeness. Our central insight is that Blackwell&rsquo;s Theorem, suitably relabeled, characterizes statistical discrimination in terms of statistical informativeness. This delivers one-half of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueaa107">Chambers and Echenique&rsquo;s (2021)</a> characterization of statistical discrimination as a corollary, and suggests a different interpretation of it: that discrimination is inevitable. In addition, Blackwell&rsquo;s Theorem delivers a number of finer-grained insights into the nature of statistical discrimination. We argue that the discrimination-informativeness link is quite general, illustrating with an informativeness characterization of a different type of discrimination.</details>
